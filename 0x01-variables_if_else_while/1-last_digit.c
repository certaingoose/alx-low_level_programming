/*
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

    The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
    You donâ€™t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
    The output of the program should be:
        The string Last digit of, followed by
        n, followed by
        the string is, followed by
            if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
            if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
            if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
        followed by a new line
